# Forecasting Global Temperature Rise Due to CO‚ÇÇ Emissions

## Introduction  
Climate change is accelerating, with **31% of human-caused GHG emissions** originating from agri-food systems (UN, 2020). This project predicts **yearly temperature increases** based on CO‚ÇÇ emissions data to support **policymakers & researchers** in climate strategies.

## Data Overview  
- **Source:** FAO, IPCC, Kaggle Dataset  
- **Years Covered:** 1990-2020 (31 years)  
- **Countries:** 175  
- **Features:** 31 variables (emissions, fires, food processing, transport, population)  

### **Data Challenges & Considerations**  
- **Missing Data:**  
  - NaN values in country emissions ‚Üí Imputed mean for animal agriculture.  
  - Dropped countries with excessive missing values.  
- **Scaling:** MinMaxScaler used for normalization.  
- **Feature Selection:** Removed **low-correlation (<5%) & highly correlated (>80%)** features.  
- **Largest NaN Country:** Palestine (~5M people)  
- **Smallest NaN Country:** Holy See (~528 people)  

## Questions Addressed  
### **1. Which model best predicts temperature changes?**  
‚úî **Best Model: KNN (5 neighbors)**  
- **Lowest MAE:** 0.3198 (More accurate predictions)  
- **Lowest RMSE:** 0.4197 (Fewer large errors)  
- **Highest R¬≤ Score:** 0.4965 (Explains variance in temperature changes)  

### **2. Why does feature selection matter?**  
‚úî Dropping **weakly correlated (<5%) & redundant (>80%) features** improved model accuracy.  
‚úî Final features retained: **Year, Savanna Fires, Forest Fires, Food Retail**.  

### **3. How do CO‚ÇÇ emissions affect climate tipping points?**  
‚úî Crossing **1.5¬∞C total warming** (not per year) could trigger **irreversible climate shifts** (melting ice sheets, coral reef die-off, etc.).  
‚úî Forecasting temperature changes helps **develop climate policies**.  

## Methodology  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Cleaning** ‚Üí Removed missing values, imputed NaNs, and normalized.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature Selection** ‚Üí Identified **high-impact variables**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Testing** ‚Üí Compared **KNN, Linear Regression & Random Forest** using MAE, RMSE, R¬≤.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Hyperparameter Tuning** ‚Üí Used **Grid Search** to optimize KNN (`n_neighbors`).  

## Conclusions  
‚úî **KNN (5 neighbors) is the best model**, balancing accuracy and generalization.  
‚úî **Feature selection improves predictions** by reducing noise.  
‚úî **Temperature increases due to CO‚ÇÇ emissions could accelerate climate tipping points.**  

## Future Questions  
- Can adding **meteorological variables** improve predictions?  
- How will **different emission policies** affect future CO‚ÇÇ levels?  
- Can integrating **deep learning models** refine temperature forecasts?
